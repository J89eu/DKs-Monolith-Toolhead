# DKs-Monolith-Toolhead
Designed by https://github.com/abigexplosion

This Toolhead requires A LOT of post processing it's not for the faint of heart.

I intend to make some modified versions that have;
Improved CAD
Added a timeline (DK is a menance)
Helicoil support
Regular BMG Support
PEEK tube lined filament path
15/18mm CPAP tubing

I didn't make this CAD except the SLM Sherpa Micro idler and SLM 17-4PH Heatblock, The CAD is cursed as fuck and is not representitve of my work, I'll post my version seperately in the future.
